# Introduction

## Coding Style 

Some tricks to improve your code style:

1. Sometimes add spaces between operator.
2. Add a space between *if ,for* and parenthesis.
3. Intent strictly.
4. Add bracket even if there's only one statement under *if else* statement.
5. Use meaningful names rather than *a, b, c*.
6. Separate different logic blocks with a spare line.
7. Make functions small.

For detailed coding style best practice, ***Clean Code*** by *Robert C. Martin Series* is recommended. For the reading notes of this book, please refer to my reading notes repository: * https://github.com/dongyu6666/ReadingNotes/tree/master/CleanCode*

## Greedy Algorithms

In general, problems that can be solved by greedy strategy tends to have a complicated greedy strategy. These strategies are hard to be think of for normal people. The strategy you think of is likely to be wrong (unless you're really good at algorithms and math).
